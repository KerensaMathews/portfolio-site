# Portfolio Site

A portfolio site used to display web development projects. Created with HTML5, CSS3, and mobile-first responsive design, including responsive images.

## Development Notes:

~~Contact.html, portfolio.html, rates.html: Still building.~~ 
11/7/17: 

Contact and rates pages are on the back burner for now. 
Currently (in portfolio-index.html): Rewriting hard-coded HTML into JavaScript so new portfolio items can be added as JavaScript objects. Portfolio-index.html is otherwise complete for current purpose. New items will be added as necessary.

Portfolio site is complete for current purpose. Used as my live portfolio site in conjunction with resume component. Resume.html and corresponding files are in a separate repository at KerensaMathews/dynamic-resume. (Separate repositories because they were originally separate Udacity projects with different purposes. skills tested, and languages used.)

~~### Issues with resume page:~~

~~Recently added header and footer to include portfolio site navigation. Still adjusting main.css and resume.css for display issues, specifically to keep color background seamless and fix minor spacing issues.~~

~~Resume.css needs additional work to improve responsive function of resume.html.~~

~~Troubleshooting required to fix recent problem with map - location pins are no longer displaying.~~

11/7/17: Issues listed above are fixed as of 11/5/17 update. Future issues with resume page will not be described here; they will only be detailed in resume repository readme file.
