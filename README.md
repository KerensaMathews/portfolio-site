# Portfolio Site

A portfolio site used to display web development projects. Created with HTML5, CSS3, and mobile-first responsive design, including responsive images.

## Notes:

Hosted at www.kerensamathews.com.

Contact.html, portfolio.html, rates.html: Still building.

Resume.html will be a separate repository in itself, because it was a separate Udacity project with different goals. skills displayed, and additional languages used. I'm including it here because it's linked to my portfolio on the live site. 

### Issues with resume page:

Recently added header and footer to include portfolio site navigation. Still adjusting main.css and resume.css for display issues, specifically to keep color background seamless and fix minor spacing issues.

Resume.css needs additional work to improve responsive function of resume.html.

Troubleshooting required to fix recent problem with map - location pins are no longer displaying.
